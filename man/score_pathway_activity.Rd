\arguments{
\item{expression_matrix}{A matrix of expression values (genes x samples)}

\item{method}{Scoring method: "GSVA" (default), "ssGSEA", "AUCell", "mean", "median", "maxmean"}

\item{min_set_size}{Minimum genes required in a gene set (default: 1)}

\item{max_set_size}{Maximum genes allowed in a gene set (default: Inf)}

\item{parallel}{Logical, use parallel processing (default: FALSE)}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to specific scoring methods}
}
\value{
Matrix of pathway scores (pathways x samples)
}
\description{
Calculates pathway activity scores from gene expression data using various
scoring methods. This is used internally by analyze_pathways() but can also
be used standalone for custom analyses.
}
\details{
**Scoring Methods:**

*GSVA (Gene Set Variation Analysis):*
- Non-parametric, rank-based method
- Estimates variation of pathway activity over sample population
- Good for detecting subtle coordinated changes
- Values roughly centered around 0

*ssGSEA (single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis):*
- Sample-level enrichment scores
- Based on Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic
- Values between -1 and 1
- Good for comparing pathway activity across samples

*AUCell (Area Under the Curve):*
- Area under the recovery curve
- Robust to dropouts (good for single-cell)
- Values between 0 and 1
- Less sensitive to outliers

*Mean Expression:*
- Simple average expression of pathway genes
- Fast and interpretable
- Good for initial exploration
- Values in same scale as input expression

*Median Expression:*
- Median expression of pathway genes
- More robust to outliers than mean
- Good for noisy data

*MaxMean:*
- Mean of top 50% expressed genes in pathway
- Reduces noise from lowly expressed genes
- Good compromise between mean and maximum

# Calculate AUCell scores (good for single-cell)
