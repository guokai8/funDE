\usage{
get_gene_families(
  database = "HGNC",
  species = "human",
  min_size = 2,
  max_size = 100,
  include_groups = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{database}{Character specifying database: "HGNC" (default)}

\item{species}{Character, "human" or "mouse"}

\item{min_size}{Minimum family size (default: 2)}

\item{max_size}{Maximum family size (default: 100)}

\item{include_groups}{Character vector of family types to include (default: all)}
}
\value{
Named list where names are family names and values are gene vectors
}
\description{
Retrieves gene family annotations from HGNC or other sources.
Returns gene family mappings for use with family-level analysis.
}
\details{
**HGNC Gene Families:**
- Based on sequence similarity and functional relationships
- Includes protein families, gene clusters, pseudogenes
- Regularly updated by HGNC
- Available family types include:
  - "protein_coding": Protein-coding gene families
  - "pseudogene": Pseudogene families
  - "lncRNA": Long non-coding RNA families
  - "miRNA": microRNA families

**Custom Families:**
- Users can provide custom family definitions
- Useful for functional groups, complexes, or pathways
- Should be provided as named list or data.frame

\examples{
# Get HGNC families for human
hgnc_families <- get_gene_families("HGNC", species = "human")
length(hgnc_families)

# Get only protein-coding families
protein_families <- get_gene_families(
  "HGNC", 
  species = "human",
  include_groups = "protein_coding"
)
