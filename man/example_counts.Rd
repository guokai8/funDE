\title{Example Count Data}
\format{
A matrix with 2000 rows (genes) and 24 columns (samples):
\describe{
  \item{rows}{Gene symbols (e.g., "GENE_0001", "GENE_0002", ...)}
  \item{columns}{Sample IDs (e.g., "Sample_01", "Sample_02", ...)}
  \item{values}{Raw RNA-seq read counts (integers)}
}
}
\source{
Simulated data created for funDE package demonstration
}
\usage{

}
\description{
A simulated RNA-seq count matrix for demonstrating funDE functionality.
Contains 2000 genes across 24 samples with two experimental conditions.
}
\details{
This dataset was simulated to include:
- 2000 genes total
- 12 samples per condition (treated vs control)
- ~200 truly differentially expressed genes
- Realistic count distributions and overdispersion
- Gene names that can be mapped to pathway databases

The data follows a negative binomial distribution typical of RNA-seq data
and includes both highly and lowly expressed genes to represent realistic
experimental conditions.
