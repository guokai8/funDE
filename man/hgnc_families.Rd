\title{HGNC Gene Family Mappings}
\format{
A named list with gene family mappings:
\describe{
  \item{names}{Gene family names (e.g., "Ribosomal_proteins_cytosolic_40S")}
  \item{values}{Character vectors of gene symbols belonging to each family}
}
}
\source{
Human Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) via genenames.org
}
\usage{
hgnc_families
}
\description{
A subset of Human Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) gene family
classifications for use with family-level analysis.
}
\details{
This dataset contains curated gene family assignments from HGNC including:
- Ribosomal protein families (40S and 60S subunits)
- Heat shock protein families (HSP70, HSP90)
- Immunoglobulin families (heavy and light chains)
- Histone protein families (H1, H2A, H2B, H3, H4)
- Metallothionein family

These families represent well-characterized functional groups that
demonstrate coordinated regulation in many biological contexts.
