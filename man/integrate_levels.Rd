\description{
Integrates and prioritizes findings across different functional levels
(genes, families, pathways) to provide comprehensive biological insights
and identify the most robust and significant patterns.
}
\details{
**Integration Methods:**

*Rank Aggregation:*
- Combines feature rankings across levels using Robust Rank Aggregation (RRA)
- Identifies features consistently highly ranked across levels
- Good for finding robust signals regardless of statistical method

*Evidence Scoring:*
- Assigns evidence scores based on significance, effect size, and consistency
- Weights can be applied to prioritize certain levels
- Produces a unified ranking of biological importance

*Consensus:*
- Identifies features significant in multiple levels
- Simple intersection-based approach
- Good for high-confidence findings

*Pathway-Guided:*
- Uses pathway structure to inform integration
- Gene-level evidence informs pathway-level conclusions
- Family-level patterns guide gene interpretation

**Biological Interpretation:**
- Features significant at multiple levels: High confidence
- Pathway-level only: Coordinated subtle changes
- Gene-level only: Strong individual effects
- Family-level: Functional redundancy or compensation
