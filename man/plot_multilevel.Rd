)
}
\arguments{
\item{results_list}{Named list of funDE results from different levels}

\item{plot_type}{Type of comparison plot: 
- "concordance": Correlation between fold changes
- "upset": Overlap of significant features using UpSetR
- "volcano_grid": Grid of volcano plots
- "summary_bar": Bar plot of significant features per level
- "rank_comparison": Rank correlation between levels}

\item{alpha}{Significance threshold (default: 0.05)}

\item{lfc_threshold}{Log fold change threshold (default: 0)}

\item{top_n}{Number of top features to include in some plots (default: 100)}

\item{color_palette}{Color palette for plots (default: NULL for default colors)}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to specific plot functions}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object or list of plots
}
\description{
Creates visualizations comparing results across different functional levels
(genes, families, pathways, etc.) to show concordance and complementarity
of different analytical approaches.
}
\details{
**Plot Types:**

*Concordance Plot:*
- Scatter plot comparing log fold changes between levels
- Shows correlation between different analytical approaches
- Points colored by significance status
- Useful for assessing consistency across levels

*UpSet Plot:*
- Shows overlap of significant features across levels
- More informative than Venn diagrams for >3 sets
- Reveals unique and shared significant features
- Requires UpSetR package

*Volcano Grid:*
- Grid of volcano plots for each level
- Easy comparison of effect sizes and significance
- Highlights level-specific patterns

*Summary Bar Plot:*
- Bar plot showing number of significant features per level
- Split by up and down regulation
- Quick overview of detection power per level

*Rank Comparison:*
- Compares ranking of features across levels
- Shows how top features from one level perform in others
- Useful for understanding complementarity

# Run analyses at different levels

# Concordance plot

# UpSet plot of significant features
plot_multilevel(results_list, plot_type = "upset")

# Summary comparison
